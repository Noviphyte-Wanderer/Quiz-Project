# Quiz Project

This is the full repository imported from VSC using Git.

It is a small quiz website built to test on available topics (Algebra and Vocabulary are the only ones so far).

It's my first multi-page project on Vanilla.

Credit to [James C Quick](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx) for the functionality.

It was inspired/derived from his tutorial.
