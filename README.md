# Quiz Project

This is the full repository imported from VSC using Git.

It is a small quiz website built to test on available topics (Algebra and Vocabulary are the only ones so far).

It's my first multi-page project on Vanilla.

Credit to [James C Quick](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDlWc9AfQBfZIkdVaOQXi1tizJeNJipEx) for the functionality.

The main functionality was inspired/derived from his tutorial.

There are four main pages:

  1. The honme page is what introduces users what the website is about.
  2. The quiz start page which acts as the quiz title screen.
  3. The quiz page which gets a set of questions and uses them at random. You try your best to answer them.
  4. The results page give you your grade.

There may be more to add in the future.
